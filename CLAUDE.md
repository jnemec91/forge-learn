# CLAUDE.md

> `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are autogenerated by `/Init`. Do not edit directly -- run `/Update` to regenerate.

Learning-focused AI skills with guided progression.

## Install / Verify

```bash
make install          # deploy agents + skills (Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode)
make verify           # check agents + skills deployed across all providers
make clean            # remove previously installed agents + skills
make test             # validate-module convention checks
make lint             # mdschema + shellcheck
```

Windows note: these Make targets use POSIX shell syntax. In PowerShell, use the fallback commands in `INSTALL.md` (`cargo build --release` + `install-agents.exe` / `install-skills.exe`) or run `make` from WSL/Git Bash.

## Identity

Read `steering/Identity.md` for the user's name, preferences, and experience level. Adjust your communication style accordingly.

Read `steering/Goals.md` for what the user is currently working toward. Reference their goals when suggesting projects or priorities.

Read any other `.md` files in `steering/` — the user may add custom rules or preferences there (e.g., `steering/MyRules.md`). Follow them.

## Skills

Skills are in `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each skill is invoked by typing its name (e.g., `/Tour`, `/Explain`). Follow the instructions in each SKILL.md exactly.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tour** | Walk through setup, directories, and available skills |
| **Progress** | Show current level and suggest next steps (Claude only) |
| **Explain** | Explain any file, error, or concept in plain language |
| **FixIt** | Diagnose problems and propose fixes |
| **GitHelp** | Translate plain English into git commands |
| **Kickstart** | Turn "I want to build X" into a plan with starter files |
| **Summarize** | Extract key points into a structured summary |

## Agents

Agent source files are in `agents/`. The starter agent `CodeHelper` explains broken code in plain language. Agents deploy to provider directories via `make install`.

## Conventions

- Explain before acting. Show what you'll do and ask for confirmation before making changes.
- Match the user's experience level. If Identity.md says "beginner", avoid jargon and use analogies.
- When something goes wrong, explain what happened and why before jumping to a fix.
- Keep responses concise. One clear paragraph beats three vague ones.

## Levels

This project has a 7-level progression. Read `steering/Levels.md` for the roadmap and current progress.

When the user seems stuck or asks what to do next, check their current level in Levels.md and suggest the next uncompleted step. The `/Progress` skill shows their level and guides them forward.

Skills are tagged by level but NOT gated — all skills work at any level. The levels guide the learning journey, not restrict access.

## Architecture

```
steering/    — who the user is (identity, goals)
skills/      — what you can do (7 invokable commands)
agents/      — AI personas (source files, deployed by make install)
modules/     — optional add-ons (may be empty)
lib/         — git submodule -> forge-lib (Rust binaries)
defaults.yaml — skill roster + agent config + provider models
config.yaml  — user overrides (gitignored), same structure as defaults
```

Platform directories (`.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`) are generated by `make install` and gitignored. Source of truth is `skills/`, `agents/`, and `defaults.yaml`.

## Git

Conventional Commits: `type: description`. Lowercase, no trailing period, no scope.
