# forge-learn

Learn to customize your AI by editing text files.

You edit a file. The AI reads it. That's all that happens.

## What Is This?

When you use an AI coding tool like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), every conversation starts from scratch — the AI doesn't know your name, your preferences, or what you're working on. You repeat yourself every session.

**forge-learn fixes that.** It's a collection of plain text files that your AI reads automatically. You tell it who you are once, and it remembers. You add skills — small instruction files — and it learns new abilities.

Everything here is a text file you can open, read, and edit. No magic, no hidden configuration, no compilation. If you can edit a document, you can customize your AI.

## Supported Tools

forge-learn is built for **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — skills are auto-discovered and slash commands (`/Tour`, `/Explain`, etc.) work out of the box.

The steering files (`steering/Identity.md`, `Goals.md`) and `CLAUDE.md` are plain markdown, so they're useful with other AI coding tools too — but skill discovery varies:

| Tool | Reads CLAUDE.md | Skills as /commands | Install |
|------|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Yes | Yes (full plugin support) | `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash` |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | Yes (fallback) | Partial (`.claude/skills/`) | `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install \| bash` |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | No (uses AGENTS.md) | No | See [Codex docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex) |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | No (uses GEMINI.md) | No | See [Gemini CLI docs](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | No (uses .github/copilot-instructions.md) | No | Via IDE |

For tools that don't read `CLAUDE.md`, you can copy the content into their instruction file format (e.g., `AGENTS.md` for Codex, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).

## What's Inside

```
steering/      <- Who you are and what you care about
skills/        <- What your AI can do (commands you can run)
agents/        <- AI personas (e.g., CodeHelper)
modules/       <- Optional add-ons (empty for now)
```

**Steering** is your identity. Open `steering/Identity.md`, change the name to yours, and save. Next session, your AI greets you by name.

**Skills** are actions. Type `/Tour` and your AI walks you through everything. Type `/Explain` and it breaks down any file or error in plain language.

**Agents** are personas. The starter agent `CodeHelper` explains broken code in plain language. You can edit it or create your own.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Claude Code

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Mac (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

**Windows (WinGet):**
```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

### 2. Download this project

Open a terminal (Mac: Terminal app, Windows: PowerShell or Git Bash) and paste:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/N4M3Z/forge-learn.git
cd forge-learn
```

This creates a `forge-learn` directory on your computer and moves into it.

> **Don't have Git?** Mac: type `git --version` in Terminal and macOS will prompt you to install it. Windows: download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).

### 3. Make it yours

Open `steering/Identity.md` in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, TextEdit — anything). Change `Your Name` to your actual name and save the file.

### 4. Start your AI tool

From inside the `forge-learn` directory:

```bash
claude
```

### 5. Type `/Tour`

Your AI will introduce itself and show you what's available.

That's it. You're set up.

## Available Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/Tour` | Walks you through your setup and available skills |
| `/Progress` | Shows your current level and suggests what to try next |
| `/Explain` | Explains any file, error, or concept in plain language |
| `/FixIt` | Diagnoses problems and proposes fixes |
| `/GitHelp` | Translates plain English into git commands |
| `/Kickstart` | Turns "I want to build X" into a plan with starter files |
| `/Summarize` | Extracts key points into a structured summary |

## Learning Path

forge-learn has a 7-level progression from your first skill modification to ecosystem contributor. Type `/Progress` anytime to see where you are and what to try next.

| Level | Name | What you learn |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Discover | Run a skill, read its source, change one line |
| 2 | Personalize | Edit identity files, see the AI adapt to you |
| 3 | Navigate | Work with files and save your progress |
| 4 | Build | Create projects from ideas |
| 5 | Author | Write custom rules, skills, and agents |
| 6 | Connect | Expand with optional modules |
| 7 | Forge | Contribute improvements to the ecosystem |

See `steering/Levels.md` for the full roadmap with progress tracking.

## How It Works

Your AI tool reads the files in this directory at the start of every session:

- `CLAUDE.md` tells it the ground rules
- `steering/Identity.md` tells it who you are
- `steering/Goals.md` tells it what you're working toward
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` gives it abilities you can invoke by name
- `agents/*.md` gives it personas it can adopt (deployed by `make install`)

You change a file, the AI's behavior changes. That's the entire system.

## Privacy Note

The `steering/` files are yours to edit with personal information (your name, goals, preferences). If you plan to push this repository to a public GitHub account, be aware that anything you write in these files will be visible. Consider keeping your fork private, or review your steering files before pushing.

## Want More?

Once you're comfortable, expand your setup with optional modules:

| Module | What it adds |
|--------|-------------|
| [forge-text](https://github.com/N4M3Z/forge-text) | 12 text processing skills — translate, simplify, grammar fix, expand, condense, and more |
| [forge-council](https://github.com/N4M3Z/forge-council) | Multi-specialist code review — a panel of experts debates your changes |
| [forge-avatar](https://github.com/N4M3Z/forge-avatar) | Deep identity — digital avatar, beliefs, strategies, communication preferences |
| [forge-steering](https://github.com/N4M3Z/forge-steering) | Behavioral rules — teach your AI what to do and what to avoid |

Clone a module into `modules/` and ask your AI to help set it up. For automated module management, see [forge-core](https://github.com/N4M3Z/forge-core).
